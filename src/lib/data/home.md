Hey! I'm Tristan. You've found yourself on my site. You can read about me, as well as my yapping about my interests, or watch me violently beat up my drum kit.

<small>This site was made using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and its [Typography plugin](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography), which looks stunning. A couple of (interactive) things use [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com), because dropdowns and tooltips are a nightmare.</small>

<!-- ## `uname -a` -->

I'm Tristan, nineteen years old and from the Netherlands. I've been obsessed with drumming for over eleven years, have a soft spot for everything computers, and I'm currently a student in Chemical Engineering.

My biggest love will however always be music â€” from collecting CDs to having seen dozens of live shows the past few years.

I've written a few thousand words about all kinds of things at [articles](/articles). Most are in English, though some might be in Dutch.

I initially built this site to publish drum covers, over at [covers](/covers). You might know some songs I did. Have a look. After that, pop over to my Instagram, where I've also posted some of them.

This might be the fifth version of this website (I'm not 100% sure). The previous one is still up, and can be found [here](https://old.tristanlukens.com). The old content (my old drum covers and blog posts) is there as well.

One more thing: all the way at the bottom of this site is a quote. Hover over it to see who it's from, and click to refresh. Cheers.
