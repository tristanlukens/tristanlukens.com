The `quotes.txt` file contains quotes by various (fictional) people, alongside some things I wrote myself. A line is structered as follows.

```
> Quote - Author (Origin)
Something I wrote - Hover text

Examples:
> Fly, you fools - Gandalf the Grey (Lord of the Rings)
You should really try ScreenZen - You really should.
```

Quotes always start with a greater than symbol (>). Every line is a new quote.
