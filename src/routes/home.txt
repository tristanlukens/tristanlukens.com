Hey! I'm Tristan. You've found yourself on my site. You can read about me, as well as my yapping about my interests, or watch me violently beat up my drum kit like it fucked my wife.

<small>This site was made using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and its [Typography plugin](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography), which looks stunning. The Profiles dropdown uses [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com), because dropdowns are a nightmare.</small>

## `uname -a`

I'm Tristan, nineteen years old and from the Netherlands. I've been obsessed with drumming for over eleven years, have a soft spot for everything computers, and I'm currently a student in Chemical Engineering. However, my biggest love will always be music. I've written a few thousand words about a lot of my interests, at [articles](/articles). Cheers.
